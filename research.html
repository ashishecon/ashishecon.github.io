                    Effects of Unmet Son Preference on Fertility Responses and Child Health: Evidence from South Asia
                </p>

                        This paper provides causal evidence on the effects of son preference on fertility behavior and child health outcomes in South Asia, exploiting quasi-random variation in the sex of the firstborn. First, we show that son preference, activated by the birth of a firstborn daughter, reduces contraceptive use, shortens birth intervals, and reduces breastfeeding duration. These responses are pronounced in India, Nepal, and Pakistan but substantially weaker in Bangladesh. Second, we show that son preference also affects child health, with estimates concentrated in India. Second-born girls with an older sister are shorter and lighter than those with an older brother, while second-born boys with an older sister are taller and heavier. Third, we document asymmetric survival responses consistent with activated son preference: girls’ survival is unaffected, but boys born after a sister are more likely to survive. Overall, the findings suggest that unmet son preference continues to shape fertility behavior and generate unequal child health outcomes.

       Planting, Harvest, and Hope: Agricultural Production and Migration Aspirations
    </p>

           This paper examines how seasonal variation in agricultural production shapes migration aspirations among rural households in Nigeria. Drawing on rich household panel data from the 2023–2024 wave of the Nigeria General Household Survey Panel (GHS Panel), we exploit within-season variation in harvest outcomes and migration intentions to estimate the short-run behavioral response to realized agricultural productivity. Our findings reveal a robust inverted U-shaped relationship: migration aspirations initially rise with improvements in harvest value but decline once households reach higher levels of productivity. This non-monotonic pattern reflects the joint influence of rising capability and diminishing incentive to migrate. Further analysis identifies food insecurity as a key moderating mechanism. Households experiencing moderate- to-severe food insecurity are significantly more responsive to agricultural shocks, with migration aspirations rising more steeply following poor harvests. These findings provide new evidence and offer actionable insights for rural development and migration management policies. By linking food security, agricultural outcomes, and migration intentions within the same season, this study highlights the dynamic nature of rural mobility preferences in response to production-based livelihood risks.

       Irrigation in Transition: Changing Patterns of Groundwater Use in Nepal
    </p>

    <p><em> Leah Bevis, Avinash Kishore, and Anton Urfels </em></p>

           Groundwater supports much of Nepal’s irrigation, yet access, timing, and costs vary widely across regions and farmers. 
        Using national and regional datasets combined with rainfall data, we provide an updated picture of irrigation in Nepal, focusing on the Terai, and present three key findings. First, irrigation in Nepal is shifting from surface water to groundwater and from diesel to electric pumps. Second, regional disparities in groundwater access remain large: the Western Terai shows higher ownership of tubewells and electric pumps, while the Eastern Terai depends more on diesel-based rentals that offer quicker but more expensive irrigation. Third, renters, mostly smallholders and tenants, continue to face higher irrigation costs and longer waiting times, especially in areas with limited rental markets and reliance on diesel fuel. Although irrigation coverage has improved slightly, average waiting times remain about five days, reflecting unreliable power supply and weak coordination.  We conclude that strengthening groundwater irrigation depends less on expanding pump capacity and more on reliable electrification, more efficient and equitable rental markets, and shorter wait times, particularly for smallholders and tenants.
